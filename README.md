# Project Overview

This project is a collection of solutions to common programming problems, implemented in multiple programming languages including Python and C++. The aim is to provide clear, efficient, and easy-to-understand examples of how to solve various types of challenges using different programming paradigms and languages.

## Features

- **Letter Classification**: Determines if a given letter is a vowel, consonant, or invalid input.
- **Palindrome Checker**: Checks if a given string is a palindrome, ignoring spaces and case sensitivity.
- **Prime Number Validator**: Validates whether a given number is prime.
- **Duplicate Finder**: Identifies duplicates in a list of numbers.
- **Two Sum Problem**: Finds pairs in an array that sum up to a specific target number.

## Languages and Frameworks

- **Python**: Used for its simplicity and readability, making it ideal for educational purposes and quick scripting.
- **C++**: Offers examples of how to solve problems with a more performance-oriented language, showcasing its use in systems programming.
- **PIP**: Python's package installer is mentioned as part of the project setup for managing Python dependencies.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine. Each problem's solution is contained within its own directory, structured as follows:

- `solutions/Question1.cpp` and `solutions/Question 1.py` for the letter classification problem.
- `solutions/Question2.cpp` and `solutions/Question2.py` for the palindrome checker.
- `solutions/Question3.cpp` and `solutions/Question3.py` for the prime number validator.
- `solutions/Question4.cpp` and `solutions/Question4.py` for the duplicate finder.
- `solutions/Question5.cpp` and `solutions/Question5.py` for the two sum problem.

Each solution can be run in its respective environment. For Python scripts, use a Python interpreter. For C++ programs, compile them with a C++ compiler like `g++` or `clang++`.
